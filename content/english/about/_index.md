Security Matters (SecM) was co-founded by activists experienced in protecting human rights defenders. Our mission is simple: to protect those driving social change, so they can continue their vital work.

We provide both digital and physical security support to activists in need. In the countries we target, there are currently no comparable efforts led by local actors. Recognizing this gap, we saw an opportunity to build a strong, sustainable, and relevant local network that delivers meaningful impact.

Through our approach, we aim to offer fast, high-quality, and purpose-fit assistance that is both effective and sustainableâ€”meeting the real and urgent needs of people at risk.
