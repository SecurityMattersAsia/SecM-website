    content: "Secure Storyteller Network (SSN) is a sub-project under Security Matters Asia, developed with the support of Berlinale Talents, the talent development programme of the Berlin International Film Festival. SSN shifts focus within the media production industry toward safeguarding at-risk crews and sensitive materials—often overlooked in traditional production planning—by embedding security-driven protocols directly into creative workflows. Responding to the growing risks posed by digital threats and sociopolitical surveillance, SSN advocates for practical, scalable solutions that protect cross-border content creators without compromising artistic integrity.
    
In collaboration with digital rights experts, and human rights networks, SSN offers training, resources, and community-based support to empower filmmakers across East and Southeast Asia. Its goal is to cultivate a sustainable culture of secure storytelling—where ethical responsibility and digital resilience are integral to every stage of the media production pipeline.
SSN will officially launch at the end of 2025.

We welcome collaboration with filmmakers, collectives, and organisations committed to building secure and ethical storytelling practices across borders. For partnership inquiries, early engagement, or more information, please contact: info@a.domain.name"
